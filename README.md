# Simple Polygon
Geometric simplification with half edge data structures and quadratic error metrics.

## Overview
 1. Convert the mesh to half edge representation
 2. Loop all the edge and calculate it's quadratic errorï¼Œthis process is speed up by a simple small heap
 3. Delete the min error edge and rebuild mesh

The left side is the original mesh, and right side is simplified mesh which only have 0.05 percents primitives.
